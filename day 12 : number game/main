#Number Guessing Game Objectives:

# Include an ASCII art logo.
# Allow the player to submit a guess for a number between 1 and 100.
# Check user's guess against actual answer. Print "Too high." or "Too low." depending on the user's answer. 
# If they got the answer correct, show the actual answer to the player.
# Track the number of turns remaining.
# If they run out of turns, provide feedback to the player. 
# Include two different difficulty levels (e.g., 10 guesses in easy mode, only 5 guesses in hard mode).

# TODO-3:create a function called compare_number(), which compare the number the player guessed and the random number. return the result of comparison.
def compare_number():
    if guess_number == random_number:
        return "You got it!"
    elif guess_number > random_number:
        return "Too high"
    elif guess_number < random_number:
        return "Too low"

# TODO-4:define a function called guess_a_nubmer(), ask the player to guess a number.
def guess_a_number():
    guess_number = int(input("Make a guess: "))
    return guess_number
# TODO-1:import logo, and create a random nubmer.

print("Welcome to the Number Guessing Game!")
print("I'm thinking of a number between 1 and 100.")
random_number = random.randint(1,100)
print(f"the correct answer is {random_number}")

# TODO-2:ask the player which mode does he want? eazy or hard. eazy has 10 chances, and hard has only 5 chances.
if input("Choose a difficulty. Type 'easy' or 'hard': ") == "easy":
    chance = 10
